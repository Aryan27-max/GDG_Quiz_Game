# ✨ Quiz App - GDG Quiz Game

---

> **Note to GDG Interview Team**  
I have pushed my limits to complete this project under a tight timeline. I would be honored if given the opportunity to join the GDG Club.
I have previously contributed to open source via GSOC 2025 through PRs in the AOOSIE (Resonate) repository.
Being a part of GDG will help me polish my Flutter and full-stack skills and strengthen my journey towards GSOC 2026 and broader Google Open Source Community involvement.
Thank you for your consideration!
